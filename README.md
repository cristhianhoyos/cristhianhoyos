## Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer dedicated to developing services in Java using Spring Boot. In my free time, I develop video games in Unity using C#. As you can see from the repository name, I use Git to deploy the code, and I often study frontend frameworks like Angular and also Flutter for mobile applications. Lastly, but not least important, I have over 5 years of experience working as a backend developer with Java.
